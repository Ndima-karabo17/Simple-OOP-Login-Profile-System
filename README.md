# Simple OOP Login & Profile System

This project is a basic login and profile system using JavaScript (with classes), SQLite3, and HTML. It allows a user to sign up, sign in, view their profile, and sign out. The app uses object-oriented programming to keep the code clean and organized.

## How to Set Up
 Make sure you have Node.js and SQLite3 installed.
 Clone or download this repo.
 Run the SQLite3 database setup script (or manually create the `users` table using the structure in the instructions).
 Open the signup.html file in your browser to begin.
All HTML files can be opened directly in a browser for testing.
If a user is not logged in and tries to open profile.html, they will be sent back to the login page.
When the user signs out, they are logged out in the database and redirected to login.
